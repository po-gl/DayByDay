# DayByDay
An iOS daily category tracker


The app is intentionally simple in tracking three categories: *Active*, *Creative*, and *Productive*.
Inspired by Apple's fitness rings, I wanted to make an app that would encourage me to be creative more often (and also active and productive).

Features:
- Track 3 categories (ðŸ”´active, ðŸŸ£creative, and ðŸŸ¢productive)
- See your past thirty days with a quick scroll down
- See further back in a calendar view
- Add notes to give your days additional context

---

I had a lot of fun designing the app; it helped me mark off many creative days.
